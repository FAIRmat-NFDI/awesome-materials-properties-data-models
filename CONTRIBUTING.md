# Contributing

Your contributions are most welcome!

## Guidelines

* Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
* Add your links like: `* [project-name](http://example.com) - A short description ends with a dot.`
* If possible, input the web domain names only, as links to the particular web-pages may expire.
* Make a remark _proprietary_ if the content is not freely available.
* Check your spelling and grammar.
* Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
